# resolved
a social platform for Actionable Resolutions

<h1> Project Description </h1>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to create a place where users can share information about specific causes, and a way for communities of people who want to take 
  positive actions towards a solution can gather learn and feel connected in their actions. The center of the idea is bridging the impact of the individual with 
  the impact of a community. The idea for this project stemmed from my use of social media and how over the past several years social media has become a main vehicle
  for spreading social awareness about causes. On instagram for example its not uncommon to see users posting and reposting information about issues taking place
  as well as steps to address those issues. However, I started to ask, just how impactful are these sources of awareness spreading when the actionability of medium
  starts and stops at spreading awareness. Even on sites like change.org where users can create and sign petitions, how often do those petitions turn into actionable 
  results. Instead I have seen that a significant portion of internet activism vehicles serve as shallow self-gratification methods letting people feel as though they
  'did' something
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Despite this there is a demand for ways to take action, especially as younger and younger generations become politically, environmentally, and socially active. 
  That got me thinking, what if people could get together just like governments and promise to actually take discreet actions (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, one-time)
  towards solving an issue, from there came the idea of the pledge format. 
</p>
<br />
<h1> How it Works </h1>
<h2>The Pledge</h2>
<p>
  The pledge is the gathering point for a community, the pledge is composed of a few pieces
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>The Statement</h4>
      <p> The statement is a general promise that this community follows, it should be in the format "We pledge to... " and should be short and concequential </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>The Mission</h4>
      <p> 
      The Mission is a more indepth breakdown of the goals this community is trying achieve. It should include an introduction to any concepts, research, history
      that is involved in the promise that the community makes. It should highlight the importance of the cause that the community is trying to get behind
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Impact Statement</h4>
      <p> 
      Like the mission, this statement is another long form section that should highlight the impact one individual can have as well as the impact that a 
      community can have together. For example if one person skips one shower a day for a year they would save roughly 6387 gallons of water per year. If one million
      people pledge to take this action that number would be over 6 billion gallons!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Action Steps</h4>
      <p>
      a pledge should have up to 6 action steps, that are composed of a few things, an action "take on day off shower a year", the unit of change "gallons"
      the degree of change "17.2" and the frequency of action "weekly" this results in a structure that allows us to compute x units / frequency. So for our water
      example, "17.2 gallons/ week" this can be represented to users individually, so for a year a user (a) saves 6200 gallons this year, or as an aggragated stat of the 
      community, community (A) saved 3.3 million gallons this year. based on how long the user promises to take an action as long as they hold to their word we can 
      estimate that a user takes a degree of action for any period since signing the pledge.

  </ul>
